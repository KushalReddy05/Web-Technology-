   <h2 ><strong>Review</strong></h2>
    <p>In 3102 BC, following the Kurukshetra War, Ashwatthama attempts to kill UttarƒÅ's unborn child.<br> For committing the act Krishna, the 8th reincarnation of Vishnu, curses him to roam the earth as an immortal and witness humanity's misery as a result of<br> societal and moral deterioration in the Kali Yuga. His divine gem is also taken from his forehead, and his redemption is destined to<br> occur only by protecting the mother of Kalki, Vishnu's 10th and final reincarnation, towards the end of Kali Yuga.

        In 2898 AD, 6,000 years after the events of the Kurukshetra War, the desertified city of Kasi <br>stands as the last known city in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by Supreme Yaskin, a totalitarian god king. Yaskin rules from the Complex, an inverted-pyramid<br> megastructure that tovers above the city. His authority is enforced by Commander Manas, Counsellor Bani, and <br>Raiders who guard against threats, particularly the prophesied arrival of Kalki.</p>
